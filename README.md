### My Token Contract

This Solidity program is a simple "Token Contract" program that demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of the Solidity programming language. This is an accessment project for ETH PROOF: Beginner EVM Course by Metacrafters.

### Description
This contract is a simple Token written in Solidity. The contract includes functionality to mint and burn tokens, along with keeping track of token balances. 
It serves as a simple and straightforward introduction to Solidity programming and can be used as a foundation for more complex projects in the future.

### Getting Started
#### Executing program
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., MyToken.sol). Copy and paste the code in the `MyToken.sol` file of this repo into the file:

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to `0.8.18`, and then click on the `Compile MyToken.sol` button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the `Deploy & Run Transactions` tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the `MyToken` contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the `Deploy` button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the `mint` and `burn` function. Click on the `MyToken` contract in the left-hand sidebar, and then click on the `mint` and `burn` function. Provide an address and value. Finally, click on the `transact` button to execute the function.
